A package of tools I have made for working with images from the CLIO camera onMag-AO on Magellan Clay telescope.  Each function contains description of what it does and the arguments.  Compatible with python 3.7.

See tutorials for description and examples of functions.  If you use any of this in your work please credit me.
Notebooks preceeded by '-' are wrappers which use the functions as they're intended to be used on a BDI dataset, they do not explain anyhting about the functions, they just use them.  'tutorial's contain more decription and discusson of function and are designed to teach and show what the functions do.
